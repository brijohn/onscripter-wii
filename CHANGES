2009-01-10

  Various bugfixes, notably CTRL-quake and mouseOverCheck stale-button
  crashes. [Mion]


2008-11-18

  GCC 4.3 introduces a whole bunch of new warnings for ambiguous
  parentheses and unchecked IO errors.  Applied a patch contributed by
  Tatu Kilappa that fixes most of these, and fixed the rest
  myself. [Haeleth]


2008-10-18

  Audio mixer now reinitializes itself when streaming audio format
  changes. [Mion]


2008-08-23

  Fixed some potential buffer overruns; thanks to Ivan Yanikov for the
  patches. [Haeleth]


2008-07-04

  Added return value 4 in "isskip" command for whole page mode. [Mion]

  Changed refreshSurface with windowback mode to draw a z-order sprite 
  in front of the tachie but behind the textwindow;
  Added windowchip handling to refreshSurface. [Mion]

  Added "textbtnoff" command, fixed textbtn handling & updated test.
  [Mion]

  
2008-07-03

  Fixed a bug in game loading, where if a game was running and had
  pages in the lookback buffer, subsequently loading a saved game
  with no pages wouldn't properly "clear" the existing lookback buffer.
  [Mion]

  
2008-06-27

  Added "textbtnstart", "linkcolor", "gettextbtnstr", "erasetextbtn",
  and "textexbtn" commands, along with support for textbuttons
  (using "<>"). [Mion]

  Added tracking of text colors on current page. [Mion]


2008-06-19

  Added support for pretextgosub tags (using "[]") [Mion]

  Added support for in-text variable assignment (using "{}"). [Mion]


2008-06-14

  Added emulation of "cascade" dll plugin effect. [Mion]


2008-06-10

  Reworked text buffer processing to do proper text placement when
  locate commands were used. [Mion]


2008-04-04

  Added "addkinsoku" and "setkinsoku" commands [Mion]

  Reworked text processing to allow a mix of 1-byte & 2-byte chars,
  use better English space-based linebreaking and Japanese kinsoku-based
  linebreaking. [Mion]


2008-03-29

  Add filename-based language selection: if the executable is named
  "onscripter-en" (or "ONScripter-En", "onscripter_english", etc), it
  will use English mode by default. [Haeleth]


2008-03-22

  Implement clickskippage, and also add a debugprint command that
  dumps its parameters to stdout for convenient printf-style
  debugging. [Haeleth]

  Add a rudimentary test suite; this is far from complete, but will
  hopefully help a bit in making sure future updates don't break
  anything. [Haeleth]

  Replace the FORCE_1BYTE_CHAR compile-time option with a runtime
  "language" command.  Use "language english" to get the current
  behaviour, or pass ONScripter-En the "--english" command-line
  flag. [Haeleth]


2008-03-09

  Fix MPEG playback for movies with audio sampled at other than
  44100Hz. [Mion]

  Updated music playing code to be more in line with Ogapee's latest
  release. [Mion]

  Added save file version 2.05. [Mion]


2008-03-05

  Support added for extended sprite commands (lsp2, msp2, etc), and
  improved screenshot support (screenshot, deletescreenshot). [Mion]


2008-02-12

  Support NBZ files within SAR archives, and fix the xcode
  project. [Roine]


2008-01-03

  Numerous patches [Mion]: 
    * Fix bugs in prnum
    * Remove extra newlines in built-in save/load menus
    * Modify skip-to-wait mode to fix Higurashi problems
    * Allow multiple archive paths, to facilitate distributing patches
    * Fix intermittent crashes with multicore processors
    * Fix input breakage in auto mode

    
2007-11-11

  Simplify handling of the click-wait enum.

  Temporarily disable skip_to_wait; there's breakage somewhere that's
  causing nasty side-effects in Higurashi.


2007-07-20

  Adjust btnwait to match NScripter behaviour more closely.  (Further
  tests are required to confirm that this doesn't break any edge
  cases.)


2007-06-20

  Fix an OS X bug causing bundled games to fail.


2007-06-12

  Get the build working on Solaris (a useful benchmark for how well
  things work on less Linux-like platforms) and NetBSD (a useful step
  towards my ultimate goal of a visual novel on every toaster).

  Fix some more MinGW build errors.

  Add the missing `install' target.


2007-06-07

  Fix some errors when mixing internal and system libraries.
  Improve support for FreeBSD.


2007-05-13

  Attempt to detect when a PNG image is using an NScripter-style mask
  area for transparency rather than a PNG alpha channel; add
  command-line flags and compile-time options to force either
  behaviour if auto-detection fails.  This should fix games like
  Tsukihime which were broken by the addition of alpha channel
  support.


2007-05-06

  Fix some bugs: parsing of arguments, saving of vertical text,
  and compilation without INSANI defined.


2007-05-01

  Merge in some more changes from Roine designed to make life better
  for OS X users:
    * Include an Xcode project to simplify Mac builds.
    * If game resources are not in the app's bundle, look for them in
      the application path instead.
    * Store saves and other data under Application Support, not
      Preferences.


2007-04-27

  Merge in Roine's scaling patch.  This is considered experimental,
  and will currently only be enabled if RCA_SCALE is defined at
  compile-time.

  Fix a silly bug in the previous mergings.


2007-04-25

  Merge in an adapted version of the `drawfix' patch to speed up
  screen updates in windowed mode, plus a number of other patches:
    * Support both SAR and NSA archives at the same time [zalas]
    * Reduce flicker when sprites are changed [Roine Gustafsson]
    * Fix gcc detection on OS X [Roine]
    * Display missing game data error as a dialog on OS X [Roine]
    * Support multiple games without game IDs at the same time [Roine]
    * Fix incorrect clipping of text shadow [Roine]


2007-04-15

  Merge in useful fixes from onscripter-20070206.


2007-04-08

  Update build system to use a configure script that generates a
  platform-appropriate makefile.  This also verifies that all required
  dependencies are available, and provides the option of building
  local libraries as required.  The end result is a package that can
  reasonably be distributed in source form for Linux users.
  In the process support for PSP, iPod, etc. has been removed; it
  could be replaced easily enough if anyone was available to test.

  Translate README.

  To make life easier with existing games, add the ability to store
  game ID in a file `game.id' as an alternative to modifying 0.txt.


2006-11-22

  Implement default data/save separation for Windows and Linux too.
  On Windows, saves go under the global Application Data folder; on
  Linux and other Unix-like systems, they go in a dotdir in the user's
  home directory.  These changes enhance Vista compatibility
  considerably, and make it possible to package Linux games in a way
  that respects the FHS.


2006-09-05

  Fix typo in usage summary.
  
  Remove unnecessary diagnostics.

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
